  <p>
    몇몇 부가 컴포넌트는 아파치 톰캣과 함께 사용되었을 것이다. 
    이 컴포넌트들은 필요한 사용자들에 의해 빌트 되었거나 미러 중 하나로부터 다운로드 될 수 있다.
  </p>

  </section>

  <section name="Downloading">
  <p>
    To download the extras components open the Tomcat download page and
    select "browse" from the Quick Navigation Links. The extras components can be
    found in bin/extras.
  </p>
  </section>

  <section name="Building">

    <p>
      The additional components are built using the <code>extras</code> target
      of the standard Tomcat Ant script which is present in the source bundle of
      Tomcat.
    </p>

    <p>The build process is the following:</p>

    <ul>
    <li>Follow the <a href="building.html">build instructions</a> to build a
        Tomcat binary from the source bundle (note: it will be used by the build
        process of the additional components, but does not need to be actually
        used later on)</li>
    <li>Execute the command <code>ant extras</code> to run the build
        script</li>
    <li>The additional components JARs will be placed in the
        <code>output/extras</code> folder</li>
    <li>Refer to the documentation below about the usage of these JARs</li>
    </ul>

  <subsection name="Full commons-logging implementation">

  <p>
    Tomcat uses a package renamed commons-logging API implementation which is
    hardcoded to use the java.util.logging API. The commons-logging additional
    component builds a full fledged package renamed commons-logging
    implementation which can be used to replace the implementation provided with
    Tomcat. See the <a href="logging.html">logging</a> page for usage
    instructions.
  </p>

  </subsection>

  <subsection name="Web Services support (JSR 109)">

  <p>
    Tomcat provides factories for JSR 109 which may be used to resolve web
    services references. Place the generated catalina-ws.jar as well as
    jaxrpc.jar and wsdl4j.jar (or another implementation of JSR 109) in the
    Tomcat lib folder.
  </p>

  <p>
    Users should be aware that wsdl4j.jar is licensed under CPL 1.0 and not the
    Apache License version 2.0.
  </p>

  </subsection>

  <subsection name="JMX Remote Lifecycle Listener">

  <p>
    The JMX protocol requires the JMX server (Tomcat in this instance) to listen
    on two network ports. One of these ports can be fixed via configuration but
    the second is selected randomly. This makes it difficult to use JMX through
    a firewall. The JMX Remote Lifecycle Listener allows both ports to be fixed,
    simplifying the process of connecting to JMX through a firewall. See the <a
    href="config/listeners.html">listeners</a> page for usage instructions.
